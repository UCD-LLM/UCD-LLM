This library management system is designed for use by librarians and readers. Readers can check their library collection, make online reservations for borrowed books, renew their borrowed books, and view their borrowing records and overdue fines. When searching for library collections, readers can perform simple or advanced combination queries. The librarian is responsible for handling book borrowing, managing reader accounts, and managing book information.
