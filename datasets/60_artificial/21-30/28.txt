The users of this order management system include administrators and customers. The system needs to provide functions such as product browsing, order creation, order modification, order cancellation, order query, and order tracking. Customers can view product details, select products, and create orders. Customers can modify or cancel orders before payment. Administrators can view the status of all orders, process orders (such as confirmation, shipment, completion, etc.), and handle abnormal orders when encountering special situations. The system needs to support multiple payment methods and send notifications to customers after the order is completed. In addition, the system also needs to record order history for customers and administrators to query past order information.
