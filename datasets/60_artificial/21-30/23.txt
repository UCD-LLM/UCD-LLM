I hope to develop a financial statement analysis tool that will have the following requirements:
1. User registration and login function: Users can use their own username and password to log in and use this tool.
2. Financial report import function: Users can import financial report files into this tool, which supports various common financial report formats such as Excel and CSV.
3. Data visualization and chart display function: Users can use imported financial statement data to generate visual charts such as bar charts and line charts for a more intuitive understanding of the data.
4. Key indicator calculation function: Users can use tools to calculate various key financial indicators, such as profit margin, asset liability ratio, etc., to help evaluate the financial situation of the enterprise.
5. Custom report generation function: Users can generate financial statement analysis reports based on the indicators and time ranges they need to display. After generating a custom report, users can choose to export the generated financial analysis report in PDF, Excel, or other formats and share it with others for viewing and analysis.
