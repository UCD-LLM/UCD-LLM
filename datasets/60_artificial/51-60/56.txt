The intelligent medical diagnosis system assists doctors in accurately diagnosing diseases by analyzing patient data and medical images. 
Doctors can use the system to input examination findings, review AI-generated diagnostic suggestions, and finalize treatment plans. 
Radiologists and pathologists rely on the extended subsystems to annotate images, they can choose to generate detailed reports further.
Hospital administrators oversee system usage, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations, and manage user roles (doctors, specialists, admins) through a centralized access control module.
