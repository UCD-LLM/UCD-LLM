In order to provide more convenient services to car rental customers, they should be able to complete the vehicle booking process through an online platform. When making an online reservation, customers need to first select a suitable car model based on their own needs and determine the specific rental period. They also need to provide their driver's license information as required, and carefully read and confirm their agreement to the rental terms. After completing these steps, they can successfully book the vehicle. When customers go to the store to pick up their cars, store employees are responsible for handling the pick-up matters. During this process, employees must strictly verify the customer's identity information to ensure consistency with the information provided at the time of booking. After verification is passed, they also need to sign a formal rental contract with the customer. Only after the contract is signed can the customer smoothly take away the rented vehicle.
