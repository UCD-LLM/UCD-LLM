I hope to develop a medical imaging management system with the following functions:
Doctors can access the system through the Internet and log in with their personal accounts.
The system needs to provide a user interface where doctors can upload, store, view, and manage patients' medical imaging data, such as X-rays, CT scan images, etc.
The system should support multiple formats of medical imaging files to ensure compatibility and ease of use.
Doctors can annotate and measure images to assist in the diagnostic process.
The system needs to have a powerful search function that allows doctors to quickly retrieve the required imaging data based on patient names, medical records, or other keywords.
In order to protect patient privacy, the system must strictly comply with relevant data security regulations, ensuring that all sensitive information is encrypted and only authorized personnel can access it.
The system should also provide a report generation function, where doctors can generate diagnostic reports based on imaging data and choose to send them to patients or relevant medical institutions according to actual needs.
Administrators need an interface to manage user permissions, including adding, modifying, and deleting user accounts.
