Develop a registration system to more effectively manage and track the information of applicants, with the following features:
1. Applicants can log in to the system using their username and password.
2. The system can automatically record the registration time of applicants.
3. Administrators can view the applicant's registration records and choose to generate registration reports for statistical analysis when needed.
4. Administrators should be able to handle abnormal registration situations, such as duplicate registrations, error messages, etc., and take corresponding measures.
5. Administrators can manage the accounts of applicants, such as adding, modifying, and deleting them.
6. The registration system needs to provide a user-friendly interface for easy operation and management.
7. The registration system should have data security to protect the personal information of applicants from leakage and abuse.
The registration system aims to provide a comprehensive, efficient, and easy-to-use registration management solution that can help institutions or organizations improve registration efficiency, reduce workload, and provide data support for decision-making reference.
