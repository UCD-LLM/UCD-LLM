Our restaurant's ordering system is aimed at both customers and servers. By integrating diverse functions, it aims to provide customers with a convenient dining experience and assist servers in efficiently completing their service work. When customers dine, they can easily perform multiple operations with the help of tablet devices on the dining table: browse the electronic menu at any time, learn about the names, pictures, prices, and specialties of each dish, select their favorite dishes, and directly add them to the shopping cart for easy viewing of selected dishes and total prices; After confirming the order content, submit the request and choose to serve immediately or all dishes together according to your own needs; If you want to add dishes during the dining process, you can complete it by operating the tablet again; After dining, customers can initiate checkout requests independently, supporting two payment methods: cash payment or QR code payment, and flexibly adapting to different payment habits; If assistance is needed, such as changing tableware, consulting problems, etc., you can also call the waiter through the tablet for timely help.
Waiters efficiently connect with customer needs through the system: receiving real-time ordering orders submitted by customers, carefully verifying dish information, and confirming to ensure accurate delivery of orders to the kitchen; After the dishes are prepared, be responsible for accurately delivering them to the corresponding customers' tables; Timely handle customers' requests. Through this system, customers can enjoy independent and convenient ordering services, and the work of servers can be more efficient and orderly, thereby improving the overall operational efficiency and service quality of the restaurant.
