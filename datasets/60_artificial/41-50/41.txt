I hope to develop a blog management system to more effectively publish, manage, and maintain blog content.
Bloggers and administrators are users of the system. Users can log in to the system using their username and password;
The system needs to provide content creation functionality, allowing bloggers to create, edit, and publish blog articles;
Administrators can set the classification, tags, and keywords of articles for users to retrieve;
The system needs to provide comment management functionality, allowing bloggers and administrators to view, review, and reply to comments;
Administrators can set up a comment review mechanism to prevent spam comments and abuse;
Administrators can manage user accounts, such as adding, modifying, and deleting them;
