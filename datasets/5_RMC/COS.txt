The system shall let a Patron, who is logged into the COS; place an order for one or more meals. The system shall confirm that the Patron is registered for payroll deduction to place an order. If the Patron is not registered for payroll deduction, the system shall give the Patron options to register now and continue placing an order, to place an order for pickup in the cafeteria, or to exit from the COS. The system shall prompt the Patron for the meal date. If the meal date is the current date and the current time is after the order cutoff time, the system shall inform the patron that it's too late to place an order for today. The Patron may either change the meal date or cancel the order. The Patron shall specify whether the order is to be picked up or delivered. If the order is to be delivered and there are still available delivery times for the meal date, the Patron shall provide a valid delivery location.
