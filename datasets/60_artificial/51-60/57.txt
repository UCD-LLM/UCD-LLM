Online learning platforms provide students with convenient homework submission functions. 
Students can submit assignments for the corresponding courses through the platform within the designated submission time period. 
When submitting homework, on the one hand, it is necessary to upload the homework file in a format that meets the teacher's pre-set requirements (such as Word, PDF, PPT, and other common formats), and the file size should be controlled within the range specified by the platform to avoid upload failure due to the file being too large; 
On the other hand, it is necessary to fill in the submission instructions, which may include the completion ideas of the homework, the problems encountered, and notes on special circumstances, so that teachers can better understand the completion status of students' homework. ​
Teachers need to have homework grading function on the platform, and the entire grading process should include the following operations: firstly, teachers can download homework files submitted by students online, supporting batch or single download, which is convenient for flexible processing according to actual needs; 
Secondly, after the grading is completed, the teacher should enter specific scores for each assignment, which should be based on preset grading standards. At the same time, targeted feedback should be filled in, including the strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions of the assignment, to help students clarify their own learning situation. ​
