To assist doctors in efficient and accurate diagnosis, we plan to develop a medical system that supports diagnosis and treatment processes and is equipped with management mechanisms. The specific requirements are as follows:
When doctors use this system, they can record patient complaints, access historical medical records, and record physical examination results; Can issue examination and testing forms based on the condition, quickly review the results after they are available, and develop treatment plans based on all the information.
The system supports the issuance of various specific types of examination and testing forms: blood examination forms are designed for blood related indicators, such as blood routine, biochemical indicators, etc; The imaging checklist focuses on imaging examinations such as X-rays, CT, MRI, etc; Microbial inspection checklist is used for bacterial culture, drug sensitivity testing, etc.
Viewing results also corresponds to specific types: blood test results provide relevant indicator data and reference ranges; The imaging examination results can access imaging data and diagnostic reports; The microbiological examination results include bacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing.
The system administrator is responsible for managing doctor accounts, maintaining the diagnostic knowledge base, and backing up system data to ensure stable system operation
