I hope to develop an electronic form software to help users manage and track form data. The following are specific requirements:
1. User login function: Users can log in to the system using their username and password.
2. Form creation function: Users can create custom forms, including input fields and options.
3. Form filling function: Users can fill in the created form and enter the corresponding data.
4. Form submission function: Users can submit completed form data and save it to the system.
5. Form viewing function: Users can view submitted form data for further processing and analysis.
6. Form editing function: Users can edit and modify the submitted form data.
7. Form deletion function: Users can delete submitted form data to clean up invalid or expired data.
8. Data export function: Users can export form data to Excel or other formats for further processing and analysis.
9. Data statistics function: The system can perform data statistics, generate charts and reports based on the fields and conditions selected by the user.
10. Data query function: Users can quickly query specific form data by entering keywords or selecting criteria.
11. User management function: Administrators can manage users, including adding, modifying, and deleting user permissions.
12. System logging function: The system will record user operation logs for tracking and reviewing user behavior.
13. Interface friendliness: The system should have a simple and intuitive user interface, which is convenient for users to operate and use.
Overall, I hope to develop a feature rich and easy-to-use electronic form software aimed at improving users' work efficiency and data management level.
