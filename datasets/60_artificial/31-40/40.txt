To achieve efficient management and secure operation of bank accounts, we plan to design a core bank account management system with the following specific requirements:
As the main operator of the system, tellers can complete multiple core tasks through the system: firstly, they can verify customer identities to ensure the security and compliance of business transactions; Secondly, new bank accounts can be created according to customer needs and closed in compliance with regulations; It can also handle account deposit and transfer transactions, ensuring the normal flow of funds; In addition, the account balance can be checked at any time to provide customers with real-time account information.
In terms of creating new accounts, the system supports multiple specific types to meet the needs of different customers: creating a checking account is one form, mainly suitable for customers' daily transactions, facilitating the issuance and payment of checks; Creating a savings account focuses on providing customers with deposit interest bearing services, suitable for storing long-term idle funds; Creating a fixed-term deposit account is aimed at customers with fixed term deposit needs, usually with relatively high interest rates, to meet their stable financial management needs.
When processing deposit transactions, the system supports multiple different methods: handling cash deposits is the most direct form, receiving cash deposited by customers and depositing it into the account; Processing check deposits involves receiving checks submitted by customers and depositing the corresponding amount into the account after verification is completed.
Customers can also conveniently use some functions of the system. They can check their account balance through online banking, which is the same as the query function performed by tellers, ensuring consistency and real-time account information.
The backend auditor is responsible for system supervision and risk control, including generating daily transaction reports that comprehensively reflect the bank's transaction situation; Verify the general ledger of the account to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the accounts; At the same time, monitoring transactions, timely marking suspicious transactions, providing support for risk prevention and control of banks, and ensuring the safety of bank funds and operational compliance.
