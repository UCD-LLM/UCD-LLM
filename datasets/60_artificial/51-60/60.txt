To ensure the efficient operation of remote polar scientific research stations, a set of material management, order forecasting, and remote collaboration systems has been specially designed. The system needs to meet the work needs of various personnel in the scientific research station, ensuring timely supply of materials, reasonable task arrangement, and smooth cooperation. The specific requirements are as follows:
In their daily work, scientific expedition team members need to register the consumption of various materials, including food, fuel, experimental consumables, etc. When there is a shortage of materials, they can submit a request for material replenishment. In the process of submitting an application, it is usually necessary to first check the current inventory level, and before submitting the application, team members will also estimate the material demand for a period of time in the future to ensure the rationality and accuracy of the application. ​
As a special member of the scientific expedition team, the chief of the scientific expedition station bears more important management responsibilities. They are responsible for approving material applications and ensuring the reasonable use of materials; Develop the final supply order, integrating all approved applications while fully considering transportation windows and various constraints to ensure the feasibility of the supply plan; Manage team members' task scheduling and allocate human resources reasonably; In addition, it is necessary to regularly release weekly reports on the status of scientific research stations, so that all parties can understand the operation of the scientific research stations. ​
The remote logistics coordinator is mainly responsible for processing and tracking supply orders, and keeping track of the progress of orders in real time; Coordinate transportation arrangements to ensure timely delivery of materials; After the materials arrive, confirm that they are stored in the warehouse. When dealing with complex orders, they may also need to negotiate with suppliers on details to ensure the smooth execution of the order. ​
The work of meteorological analysts is also crucial. The key meteorological forecast data they provide will have a direct impact on transportation arrangements and also influence the forecast of material demand for certain outdoor operations, providing important references for material supply and operation arrangements. ​
The predictive model in the system will play a data support role by analyzing historical consumption data, generating demand forecasting reports, providing scientific basis for material supply planning and demand estimation, and helping to improve the foresight and effectiveness of material management.
