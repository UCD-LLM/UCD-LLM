I hope to develop a blog platform that allows users to create personal blogs and publish articles. Users can log in to the system using their username and password, and the system will record their login information. Users can create, modify, and delete their own blogs on the blog platform, as well as edit, publish, and delete articles. The platform should also provide a comment function, allowing users to comment on other users' articles. Administrators should be able to manage user accounts, including adding, modifying, and deleting users. In addition, the platform should also have a search function to facilitate users in searching for topics or articles that interest them. I hope this blog platform can provide a good user experience, with a simple and clear interface, rich and easy-to-use features.
