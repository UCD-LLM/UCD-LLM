I hope to develop a movie booking system to facilitate users in selecting and booking movie tickets.
Users can access the movie booking system by registering and logging into the system.
The system needs to provide a list of movies and detailed movie information, including movie names, directors, actors, genres, release times, etc.
Users can browse the movie list according to their preferences and needs, and select the movies they want to order.
The system needs to provide seat reservation function, where users need to choose a cinema and seats, and book designated seats.
The system should support online payment methods, and users need to choose appropriate payment methods to complete the payment of movie tickets.
The system should provide electronic ticketing functionality, where users can receive electronic tickets upon successful booking and verify them through their mobile phones or printed electronic tickets upon entry.
The system should provide user account management functionality, allowing users to view order history, manage personal information, and change passwords.
The system should have a good interface design and user experience, making it convenient for users to operate and browse movie information.
The movie ticketing system aims to provide a convenient, reliable, and efficient solution for movie ticketing management, providing users with a good viewing experience and choices.
