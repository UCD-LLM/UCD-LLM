The automated assembly line monitoring system is dedicated to real-time monitoring and effective management of the operating status of the production line, ensuring the efficiency and stability of the production process.  
The system automatically collects and records operational data of equipment, including key indicators such as production speed, fault information, energy consumption, and has real-time alarm function.  
Operators can observe the status of the assembly line in real time through the monitoring interface, control operations, and quickly handle abnormal situations when problems occur.  
Maintenance engineers use the detailed equipment status information and fault logs provided by the system for preventive maintenance and troubleshooting, ensuring the continuous operation of the equipment.  
The production manager can view the production situation and choose to generate analysis reports to monitor production progress and evaluate efficiency.  
The system administrator has privileges to view the operation records of all employees and can choose to generate comprehensive production reports for in-depth analysis of production line efficiency.
The system administrator is also responsible for managing system users, including adding and deleting users, to comprehensively improve the management level and production efficiency of the production line.
