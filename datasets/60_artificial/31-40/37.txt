For financial personnel, the system needs to support batch uploading of invoice information and automatically generate electronic invoices, including blue invoices with normal amounts and red invoices with negative amounts. It also needs to be able to modify and delete existing invoices. For customers, the system needs to provide a convenient platform to receive electronic invoices and query historical invoice records in the system.
