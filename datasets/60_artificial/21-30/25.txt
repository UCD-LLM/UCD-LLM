4. Order management and tracking function: Users can view the status and logistics information of orders, making it convenient to track the delivery process of goods.
5. Payment and refund functions: The platform should support multiple payment methods and provide a secure payment environment. At the same time, there needs to be a refund function so that users can return and refund when encountering problems.
6. User evaluation and recommendation function: Users can evaluate the purchased products for reference by other users. The platform can also provide personalized product recommendations based on users' purchase history and interests.
