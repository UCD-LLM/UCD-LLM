Design a deep-sea diving support system for professional diving teams/research vessels.
Divers must develop a diving plan (including target depth, time, and gas mixture) before each dive. During the diving process, the system will automatically record depth and time data. Divers need to keep a diving log, including manually recording observation notes and marking key event points (such as discovering targets and inspecting equipment).
A diving master is a special type of diver. The diving master needs to review the diving plan before diving, and is responsible for generating a diving report summary and marking potential risk events after diving. The diving master can receive signals sent by divers, and when an emergency distress signal is received, the emergency response process will be initiated.
Surface support personnel are responsible for monitoring the diver's status in real-time (position, depth, gas remaining), as well as managing diving gas cylinder inventory and coordinating depressurization procedures.
