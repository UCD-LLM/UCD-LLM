I hope to develop a radio station application with the following functions:
Users can download the application and log in to the system using their own account.
The radio station application needs to provide a user interface where users can browse different radio station information, including program names, playback times, program types, etc.
Users can search for specific radio stations or programs to quickly find content of interest.
The application needs to provide online listening function, allowing users to listen to live programs from various radio stations in real time.
The application also needs to provide recording and playback functions, allowing users to listen to program content that they have missed in the past period of time.
Users can bookmark their favorite radio stations or programs for quick access and listening in the future.
The radio station application should also provide an interactive feature where users can leave messages or send bullet comments to communicate and share their feelings with other listeners.
Administrators also need an interface to add, modify, and delete program information, as well as adjust the playback time of programs.
