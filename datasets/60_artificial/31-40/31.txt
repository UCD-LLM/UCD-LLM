This online retail system allows registered members and unregistered visitors to browse the product catalog. Registered members can log in to the system, manage their personal information, add products to their shopping cart, place orders to purchase products, and view their order history. When placing an order to purchase goods, registered members can choose specific payment methods to complete the transaction, such as using credit card payment or PayPal payment. In addition, registered members can contact customer service for assistance. Visitors can browse the product catalog, but they need to register as a member to make purchases. The system administrator is responsible for managing product information and managing registered member accounts.
