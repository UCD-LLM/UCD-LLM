We need to develop a fully functional online education platform system that sets corresponding functional permissions for different roles, as follows:
For visitors, they can freely browse the publicly available course catalog on the platform and learn about the basic information of various courses; You can also view detailed introductions of specific courses, including course outlines, teaching objectives, and other related content; If interested in further learning, visitors can register as platform users to access more functional experiences.
As a special type of registered user, students have richer permissions. They can log in to the platform using their account password; Choose appropriate courses based on one's own needs and interests; After logging in, you can watch the teaching videos of the selected courses and participate in course learning; Submit assignments according to course requirements and complete learning tasks; You can also participate in online quizzes corresponding to the course to verify your learning outcomes; After completing the tests and assignments, students can view the grade reports generated by the system to understand their learning situation.
Teachers are also special registered users, mainly responsible for creating and managing teaching content. Teachers can log in to their own accounts; Independently create new courses and design course structure and teaching content; Upload various teaching materials to the course, such as courseware, reference documents, etc; Publish homework based on teaching progress for students to complete; Correct the homework submitted by students; Create online quizzes to evaluate students' learning outcomes; Responsible for managing students' course grades and ensuring accurate record keeping.
A teaching assistant is a special role that combines the authority of both students and some teachers. In addition to possessing all the basic functions of students, teaching assistants can also assist teachers in correcting students' homework for the courses they assist with; And promptly answer students' questions related to the course in the course forum, helping students solve their learning doubts.
Administrators are responsible for the overall management of the platform, primarily managing the accounts of all users such as students, teachers, and teaching assistants, including account creation, deactivation, and information modification; Classify and manage courses on the platform to ensure clear and reasonable course classification; At the same time, responsible for reviewing the course content created by teachers to ensure that the course quality meets platform standards.
