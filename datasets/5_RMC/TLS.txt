A library issues loan items to each customer. Each customer is known as a member and is issued a membership card that shows a unique member number. It is necessary that the membership number and other details on a customer must be kept such as a name, address, and date-of-birth. The library is made up of a number of subject sections. Each section is denoted by a classification-mark. A loan item is identified by a bar-code. There are exactly two types of loan items, language tapes, and books. A language tape has a titlelanguage, and level. A book has a title, and author(s). It is possibility that each customer may borrow up to at most 8 items. It is possibility that each item can be borrowed, reserved or renewed to extend a current loan. When an item is issued the customer's membership-number is scanned via a bar code reader or entered manually. If the membership is valid and the number of items on loan at most 8, the book's bar-code is read, either via the bar code reader or entered manually. It is possibility that if the item can be issued the item is stamped and then issued. It is necessary that the library must support the facility for an item to be searched and for a daily update of records.
