This patient appointment system facilitates patients to book medical services and assists front desk receptionists and doctors in managing their work. Patients can register an account online, log in to the system, view doctor profiles and appointment times, make appointments for outpatient services (with the option to choose between online video consultations or offline visits), view their appointment records, and cancel appointments. Booking an outpatient appointment is the main procedure for patients. The front desk receptionist is responsible for handling patients' appointment requests and managing their basic information. Doctors can view their daily appointment schedule, record diagnosis results and treatment plans after the visit.
