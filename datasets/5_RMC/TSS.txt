An assembly unit consists of a user, a belt, a vision system, a robot with two arms, and a tray for assembly. The user puts two kinds of parts, dish and cup, onto the belt. The belt conveys the parts towards the vision system. Whenever a part enters the sensor zone, the vision system senses it and informs the belt to stop immediately. The vision system then recognizes the type of part and informs the robot, so that the robot can pick it up from the belt. The robot picks up the part, and the belt moves again. An assembly is complete when a dish and cup are placed on the tray separately by the arms of the robot.
