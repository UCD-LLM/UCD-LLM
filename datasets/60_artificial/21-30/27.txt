I hope to develop a vehicle GPS tracking system with the following functions:
Users can download the application and log in to the system using their own account.
The vehicle GPS tracking system needs to provide a user interface where users can view their vehicle's location information, driving trajectory, speed, and other data.
The system needs to support the management and tracking of multiple vehicles, allowing users to easily switch between different vehicles for monitoring.
Users can set up geofencing, and the system automatically sends notifications to users when vehicles leave or enter designated areas.
The system should provide real-time alarm functions, such as speeding, abnormal parking, etc., to ensure vehicle safety.
Users can use the history function to query the vehicle's travel route and stopping points during any time period.
The system also needs to provide energy consumption analysis to help users understand the fuel or electricity consumption of vehicles and optimize driving habits.
The administrator interface allows administrators to add, delete, and edit vehicle information while monitoring the status of all registered vehicles.
The system supports multi platform operations, including mobile apps and web platforms, making it convenient for users to view and manage vehicle information anytime and anywhere.
