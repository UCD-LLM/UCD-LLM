Develop a content management system with the following specific requirements:
As a fundamental user of the system, content editors should be able to perform a series of operations related to article creation within the system. They can start writing new articles from scratch; For existing articles, they can be modified and improved; After completing the creation or modification of the article, it needs to be submitted to the review process for further processing; At the same time, you can also check in real-time the current status of your submitted article, such as being under review, approved or not approved, in order to timely understand the progress of the article.
Content reviewers bear the important responsibility of controlling the quality and compliance of articles. They need to conduct a comprehensive review of the articles submitted by content editors, carefully checking whether the content is accurate, the viewpoints are appropriate, and whether they comply with platform standards; After review, we have the authority to approve the publication of articles that meet the requirements, so that they can be displayed to users on the platform.
Advanced editors belong to a special group of content editors, who not only have all the operational permissions of regular content editors, but also possess higher-level permissions. They can bypass the review process and directly publish articles they have written or edited, improving the efficiency of content publishing; In addition, it is also responsible for managing content classification to ensure that platform content is clearly and orderly categorized.
The system administrator is mainly responsible for the basic management and security of the system. On the one hand, they need to manage the user roles within the system to ensure the standardization of user operations; On the other hand, regular system backups should be conducted to properly store important information such as data and configuration in the system, in order to cope with possible data loss, system failures, and other issues, ensuring the stable operation and data security of the system.
