City drivers use the traffic app to find optimal routes. 
Route calculation always checks real-time congestion data from road sensors. 
During emergencies, drivers can activate SOS mode which notifies nearby patrol cars and dispatches ambulances.
Traffic officers monitor violations, while senior officers additionally coordinate disaster responses. 
All traffic officers generate incident reports, but accident reconstruction specialists create detailed 3D collision analyses using the same reporting framework.
