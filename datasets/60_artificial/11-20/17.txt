Maintenance engineers are responsible for creating maintenance work orders, and during the creation process, two core pieces of information must be accurately recorded. One is the description of equipment failure, which needs to provide a detailed explanation of the equipment model, department, time of occurrence of the failure, specific symptoms (such as abnormal sound, functional failure, display error codes, etc.), and whether the user has self handled the situation during use, providing clear fault basis for subsequent maintenance work; The second is to assign responsible engineers, who need to allocate maintenance tasks reasonably based on factors such as the type of fault, the engineer's professional field, and the current workload, to ensure that work orders can be efficiently processed. At the same time, the work order should automatically generate a unique number and record basic information such as creation time and customer information of the equipment, which facilitates the tracking and management of the work order. ​
Before the maintenance engineer completes the maintenance operation, they need to fill out a maintenance report, which should include the methods used for maintenance, the models and quantities of spare parts replaced, the analysis of the cause of the fault, and the test results of the equipment operation status after maintenance, to ensure the traceability of the maintenance process and provide reference for similar fault handling in the future; On the other hand, it is necessary to update the spare parts inventory in a timely manner, deduct inventory accordingly in the system based on the actual number of spare parts consumed during maintenance, and automatically issue replenishment reminders when the spare parts inventory is below the preset threshold to ensure the timeliness of spare parts supply. ​
Before closing a work order, the system must rigorously verify the customer's signature. After the repair is completed, the customer needs to confirm the effectiveness of the equipment repair and sign their name on the electronic signature interface associated with the system. The system needs to verify the authenticity of the signature. Only after confirming that the signature is valid and the customer has no objections to the repair results can the work order closure process be completed to protect the customer's rights, clarify repair responsibilities, and ensure the standardization of the service process.
