Your task is to extract the generalization relationships between actors from the given natural language requirement text.
Generalization relationships represent inheritance relationships between actors , where child actors inherit all structures, behaviors, and relationships from their parent actors but exhibit more specific behaviors.

The given natural language requirement text is: 
{input_text}

Now determine whether there is a generalization relationship between  {actor1} and {actor2}.

If there is a generalization relationship between two actors, output a Python tuple of actors, where the parent actor comes first and the child actor comes second.
If there is no generalization relationship between the two actors, output single word "False" without any punctuation mark.

In your answer, please strictly only output the actor pair or single word "False" and do not include any explanation or apologies.
