The system should provide users with services for creating, signing, managing, and storing electronic contracts. The contract creation function includes template selection and custom editing. When signing a contract, the system needs to ensure the security and legal validity of the contract. The signing action itself can be divided into two types depending on the signing method: one is handwritten signature, which users complete through touch devices or mice; Another type is scan code signature, where users scan the QR code generated by the platform to complete identity verification and signature on mobile devices such as smartphones. After signing, the contract should be automatically stored in the user's account and provide retrieval and download services. If the user needs to modify the signed contract, they must obtain the consent of all signatories and re sign and confirm. In addition, a contract expiration reminder function should be provided.
