Firstly, it is necessary to provide customers with the function of browsing products, allowing them to freely view various product information on the platform, including product names, pictures, details, prices, etc., making it convenient for customers to understand the product situation.
Secondly, regarding the customer ordering process, the system needs to set login restrictions, meaning that customers must first log in to their system account before placing an order. This setting can ensure the security of customer order information and facilitate the management of customer consumption records by the system.
Furthermore, during the payment processing, the system must rigorously verify the credit card information provided by customers. The verification content should include the validity of the credit card number, consistency of cardholder information, validity period, and security code to ensure the security and reliability of the payment process and avoid payment risks.
Finally, the system needs to provide product management functions for administrators. Administrators can enter detailed information about new products and add them to the platform, as well as modify information about existing products to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of product information on the platform.
