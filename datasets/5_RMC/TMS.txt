The two main functions of the Time Monitor Software System are to allow the developers to use a www browser to store timestamp records in a database, and to allow a manager to analyse these timestamp records. A timestamp record consists of the time duration of a specific activity with the unique identification. The unique identification is made of three components: the project, the user and the date when the activity is taken place. The description of an activity is divided into three components: a task name, an activity, and an artefact. For managerial purpose, it is often useful to define the date in term of the current week. The current week is defined as the week starting on the Monday immediately preceding the current day of the week and ending on the Sunday immediately following the current day of the week, inclusively. A task is unit of work defined by the manager and for which the developer is accountable. A task is a component of the schedule with a start and end date. Examples of task are: Implement module A, and Design library XYZ. Developers usually work with on assigned tasks. One developer may work on many tasks and a given task may involve many developers.
