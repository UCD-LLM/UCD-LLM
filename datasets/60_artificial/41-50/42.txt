The e-commerce platform facilitates online shopping by connecting buyers, sellers, and administrators. 
The core system includes a product catalog module that manages item listings, prices, and inventory. 
The platform contains an order processing component that handles cart management, payment, and shipping. Buyers can browse products, apply filters (e.g., price, category), and place orders. 
Sellers use a dedicated dashboard to manage their inventory, update product details, and track sales, which extends the basic catalog management with bulk upload and sales analytics features. 
Administrators oversee the entire platform, resolving disputes and monitoring transactions through a centralized control panel. 
The systemâ€™s user management module is generalized to support different user types (buyers, sellers, admins), with shared authentication logic but role-specific permissions. 
Additionally, the platform extends its payment processing to support multiple gateways (credit cards, digital wallets), each implementing a common payment interface but with unique validation rules.
